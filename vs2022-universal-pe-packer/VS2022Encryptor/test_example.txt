The packer supports multiple encryption modes:
1. Basic Encryption (AES/ChaCha20)
2. Stealth Triple Encryption
3. PE-Aware Encryption

This file can be used to test the basic encryption functionality.
The PE-Aware encryption is specifically designed for Windows executables (.exe, .dll files).

Features:
- AES-128-CTR encryption
- ChaCha20 stream cipher
- Triple-layer encryption with randomized order
- PE structure preservation
- Self-decrypting executables
- Embedded keys for self-contained operation

Test this file with different encryption modes to verify functionality.
