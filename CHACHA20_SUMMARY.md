# ChaCha20 Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully added ChaCha20 encryption support to the existing AES-based encryption project. The implementation includes both standalone ChaCha20 tools and hybrid tools that support both AES and ChaCha20 algorithms.

## New Files Added

### Core Implementation
1. **`chacha20.h`** - Pure C++ ChaCha20 implementation
   - ChaCha20 class with init(), crypt(), and setCounter() methods
   - Helper functions for ChaCha20-CTR mode
   - Key and nonce generation functions
   - No external dependencies

### Encryption Tools
2. **`chacha20_encryptor.cpp`** - Standalone ChaCha20 file encryptor
   - Generates random 32-byte keys and 12-byte nonces
   - Outputs files with format: `[32-byte key][12-byte nonce][encrypted data]`
   - Compatible with existing project patterns

3. **`hybrid_encryptor.cpp`** - Universal encryptor supporting both AES and ChaCha20
   - Command-line algorithm selection (`aes` or `chacha20`)
   - Automatic key/nonce size handling
   - Outputs files with format: `[1-byte algo_id][key][nonce][encrypted data]`

### Stub Components
4. **`chacha20_test_stub.cpp`** - ChaCha20 test stub
   - Follows same pattern as existing AES stubs
   - Includes embedded ChaCha20 key and nonce
   - Decrypts and executes payloads

5. **`hybrid_stub.cpp`** - Universal stub supporting both algorithms
   - Automatically detects encryption algorithm from payload
   - Handles both AES and ChaCha20 encrypted payloads
   - Supports the hybrid file format

### Build and Documentation
6. **`Makefile`** - Updated build system
   - Added targets for all ChaCha20 components
   - Test targets for both algorithms
   - Install/uninstall targets

7. **`README_CHACHA20.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
   - Usage examples and file formats
   - Security features and performance comparison
   - Integration guidelines

8. **`demo_chacha20.sh`** - Demonstration script
   - Shows usage of all new components
   - Compares file sizes and formats
   - Includes hex dump analysis

9. **`CHACHA20_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## Key Features

### ChaCha20 Advantages
- **256-bit security** (vs 128-bit for AES-128)
- **Better performance** on many platforms
- **Simpler implementation** than AES
- **Cache-timing resistant** (no S-boxes)
- **Modern design** optimized for software

### Compatibility
- **No breaking changes** to existing AES code
- **Same interfaces** for easy integration
- **Hybrid support** allows algorithm choice
- **Backward compatible** with existing stubs

### File Formats
- **ChaCha20**: `[32-byte key][12-byte nonce][encrypted data]`
- **Hybrid**: `[1-byte algo_id][key][nonce][encrypted data]`
- **Algorithm IDs**: 0x00=AES, 0x01=ChaCha20

## Testing Results

### Compilation
✅ All components compile successfully with g++
✅ No external dependencies required
✅ C++11 standard compliance

### Functionality
✅ ChaCha20 encryption/decryption works correctly
✅ Hybrid encryptor supports both algorithms
✅ File formats are correct and consistent
✅ Key and nonce generation works properly

### Performance
✅ ChaCha20 typically faster than AES on software implementations
✅ No significant overhead from hybrid implementation
✅ Memory usage is reasonable

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Build all components
make all

# ChaCha20 encryption
./chacha20_encryptor input.txt output.bin

# Hybrid encryption
./hybrid_encryptor input.txt output.bin chacha20
./hybrid_encryptor input.txt output.bin aes

# Run demo
./demo_chacha20.sh

# Test components
make test_chacha20
make test_hybrid
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Keys are embedded in files for demo purposes
2. **Random Generation**: Uses simple PRNG - use crypto-secure RNG in production
3. **Nonce Reuse**: Never reuse nonces with the same key
4. **Key Size**: ChaCha20 uses 256-bit keys for maximum security

## Future Enhancements

- ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD mode
- XChaCha20 for extended nonce support
- Hardware acceleration detection
- Key derivation functions
- Secure key storage integration

## Conclusion

The ChaCha20 integration is complete and fully functional. The project now supports both AES-128-CTR and ChaCha20 encryption algorithms, providing users with choice and improved performance options while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing AES-based components.
