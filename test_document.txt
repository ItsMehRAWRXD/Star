This is a test document for demonstrating the Workflow Triple Encryptor.

The encryptor will:
1. Generate a unique encryption stub
2. Compile the stub to an executable
3. Use the stub to encrypt this file
4. Create an encrypted output ready for deployment
5. Clean up temporary files

This file contains sensitive information that needs to be protected using
ChaCha20 + AES + XOR triple-layer encryption with randomized order.

File size: approximately 500 bytes
Creation date: 2024
Status: Unencrypted (original)
